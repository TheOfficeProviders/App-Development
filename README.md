# App-Development
A space where we can look at creating an app similar to Beezer but that is available in the app store.
The existing app provided general information about office space and workspace solutions such as the diffrences between leased offices and private serviced offices and coowkring spaces, for instance.
Total word count was circa 2k words on one page.
It also provided links to resources where users can find out more about office space or commercial real estate.
It also had the ability to embed video.
It provided links out to our various social media platforms and website.
The key function was to offer a contact form that gathered information about a potential office space requirement.
